# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## 🎯 Module Overview

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, you'll master **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for modern robots. Just as your nervous system coordinates communication between your brain and body, ROS 2 coordinates communication between different components of a robot.

## 🧠 What is ROS 2?

**ROS 2** is an open-source framework for robot software development. It provides:

- **Communication infrastructure**: Nodes can exchange data seamlessly
- **Hardware abstraction**: Write code once, deploy on different robots
- **Tools and libraries**: Pre-built solutions for common robotics tasks
- **Community support**: Thousands of packages and active developers

:::tip Why ROS 2 (not ROS 1)?
ROS 2 offers real-time capabilities, better security, multi-robot support, and works on embedded systems—making it ideal for production humanoid robots.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. ✅ Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
2. ✅ Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
3. ✅ Bridge Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers using `rclpy`
4. ✅ Define robot structures using URDF for humanoid robots
5. ✅ Build a simple humanoid robot controller

## 📖 Module Structure

### 1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
Learn the building blocks of ROS 2:
- Nodes: Independent processes that perform computation
- Topics: Publish/subscribe messaging for continuous data streams
- Services: Request/response patterns for occasional tasks
- Actions: Long-running tasks with feedback

### 2. Python Agents with ROS 2
Connect AI to robotics:
- Using `rclpy` to create Python nodes
- Publishing sensor data and subscribing to control commands
- Integrating machine learning models with ROS 2
- Real-time decision making in robotic systems

### 3. URDF for Humanoids
Define your robot's physical structure:
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Defining links (robot parts) and joints (connections)
- Creating a humanoid robot model
- Visualizing robots in RViz2

### 4. Hands-On Lab
Put it all together:
- Build a complete ROS 2 workspace
- Create a simple humanoid controller
- Simulate robot movement
- Integrate AI-based decision making

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- (Optional) ROS 2 Humble installed on Ubuntu 22.04 or Docker

:::info Installation Guide
