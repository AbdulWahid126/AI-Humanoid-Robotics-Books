# Module 4: Hands-On Lab

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

Integrate all components into a working autonomous humanoid system.

## 🛠️ Complete System Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice openai

# Setup workspace
cd ~/humanoid_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## 📝 Launch Complete System

Create `launch/autonomous_system.launch.py`:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        # Voice recognition
        Node(
            package='humanoid_vla',
            executable='voice_command_node',
            name='voice_command'
        ),
        
        # Cognitive planner
        Node(
            package='humanoid_vla',
            executable='cognitive_planner',
            name='planner'
        ),
        
        # Action executor
        Node(
            package='humanoid_vla',
            executable='action_executor',
            name='executor'
        ),
        
        # Navigation
        Node(
            package='nav2_bringup',
            executable='navigation_launch.py',
            name='navigation'
        ),
    ])
```

## 🚀 Run the System

```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch Isaac Sim
./isaac-sim.sh

# Terminal 2: Launch ROS 2 system
ros2 launch humanoid_vla autonomous_system.launch.py

# Terminal 3: Monitor
ros2 topic echo /robot_action
```

## 🎯 Test Commands

Try these voice commands:
- "Move forward 2 meters"
- "Find the red box"
- "Pick up the object"
- "Clean the room"
- "Bring me the cup"

## 📊 Expected Results

- ✅ Voice commands transcribed accurately
- ✅ LLM generates logical action plans
- ✅ Robot executes plans successfully
- ✅ Complete tasks autonomously
