# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## 🎯 Module Overview

The convergence of **Vision**, **Language**, and **Action**—where humanoid robots understand voice commands, reason about tasks, and execute physical actions.

## 🗣️ What is VLA?

Vision-Language-Action systems integrate:
- **Vision**: Perceive the environment
- **Language**: Understand natural language commands
- **Action**: Execute robotic tasks

## 📚 What You'll Learn

1. ✅ Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper
2. ✅ Cognitive planning with LLMs
3. ✅ Natural language to ROS 2 actions
4. ✅ **Capstone Project**: The Autonomous Humanoid

## 📖 Module Structure

### 1. Voice-to-Action
- Speech recognition with Whisper
- Intent extraction
- Command execution

### 2. Cognitive Planning
- LLM-based task planning
- Reasoning about physical constraints
- Multi-step action sequences

### 3. Capstone Project
